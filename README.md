# CSE312 - Coinflip Website
This website is designed to host virtual coinflip wagers between users, managed with virtual currency. We plan to incorporate statistics for each user, a leaderboard, rewards and more.

## Objective:
The first few weeks will be dedicated to research and planning. Many of the tools we will be using are new to us, so we will work to have a good understanding of them and implement them to a good standard. Our aim is to create a fun and engaging coinflip platform, fostering a sense of community while we develop our skills with real-world technologies.
